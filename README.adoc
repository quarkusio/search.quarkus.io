== Deployment

Deployment should happen automatically when pushing to the `main` branch.

Maintainers can review the application and update configuration/secrets
at https://console-openshift-console.apps.ospo-osci.z3b1.p1.openshiftapps.com/

Be careful about which configuration you change in the UI,
as deployment may overwrite part of the topology.
